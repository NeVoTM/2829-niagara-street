"Sale Price per Square Foot for Luxury Condominiums with Water Views in Erie County, NY and Niagara County, NY",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"Overview: The market for luxury condominiums in Erie County, NY (including Tonawanda, Amherst, East Amherst, and Buffalo) and Niagara County, NY (including North Tonawanda, Niagara Falls, Youngstown, and Lewiston) with water views (e.g., Lake Erie, Niagara River, Tonawanda Creek, or nearby waterways) is niche, with limited inventory focused on waterfront developments like Waterfront Village in Buffalo or creek-side patio homes in North Tonawanda. Luxury is defined as properties priced above $300,000, aligning with the region's median home prices of $240,000–$270,000. Data from 2024–2025 shows median sale prices per square foot (sq ft) for all homes at $195 in Erie County and similar in Niagara County, but luxury condos with water views range from $250–$450 per sq ft, driven by scenic premiums and amenities. The market is competitive, with condos averaging 9–12 days on market, and prices up 10–18% year-over-year.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"Water-view condos are often townhomes or patio-style units in developments near Lake Erie (e.g., Buffalo waterfront) or the Niagara River. Below is a table of recent sales and listings in these NY counties only, with calculated price per sq ft where available.",,,,,,,

Market Trends and Insights,,,,,,,
"Price per Sq Ft Range: Luxury water-view condos in these counties typically fall between $250–$450 per sq ft, exceeding the county medians ($195 in Erie, similar in Niagara). Lake Erie waterfront (e.g., Buffalo) commands the highest premiums ($300–$450/sq ft), while creek or river views (e.g., Tonawanda Creek in North Tonawanda) are more moderate ($250–$310/sq ft).",,,,,,,
"Erie County (Tonawanda, Amherst, East Amherst, Buffalo): Focus on Buffalo's Waterfront Village for true Lake Erie views, with medians around $339/sq ft in that area. Amherst and East Amherst have more creek-view condos in developments like Williamsburg or Cloister Square. Tonawanda offers limited options, often patio homes near creeks. Overall, 112+ condos listed, but luxury water-view ones are scarce (e.g., 12 waterfront in Buffalo).",,,,,,,
"Niagara County (North Tonawanda, Niagara Falls, Youngstown): Fewer condos overall (17 listed), with water views mainly along Tonawanda Creek or Niagara River. Patio homes in North Tonawanda dominate luxury sales; Niagara Falls has some river-view options, but many waterfront listings are single-family homes rather than condos. Median waterfront prices around $218/sq ft, but luxury exceeds this.",,,,,,,
"Market Dynamics: Sales are quick (9–12 days median), with prices rising 10–18% (e.g., Erie County median up to $309,900). Water views add significant value due to scarcity, especially Lake Erie or Niagara River frontage.",,,,,,,
"Water View Premium: Direct Lake Erie views (e.g., Buffalo waterfront) yield the highest prices; creek views (common in Amherst/North Tonawanda) provide moderate uplifts.",,,,,,,
Notes and Limitations,,,,,,,
"Data Gaps: Inventory is limited for condos specifically (many waterfront properties are single-family); examples focus on confirmed condo/townhome types with water views. No East Amherst-specific luxury condo sales with water views were detailed in sources, as it's more inland.",,,,,,,
Sources: Compiled from real estate platforms and reports; listings may not reflect final sales.,,,,,,,
"Recommendations: For current data, consult agents via sites like Zillow or Redfin. New developments near waterways may emerge in 2025.",,,,,,,

"Summary of 3-Star Hotels in Erie County, NY (Buffalo Area)",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
"Based on recent data, I've compiled a comparison of 5 top 3-star hotels in Erie County, NY (primarily in Buffalo, the main city in the county). Rates are averages for suites or larger rooms closest to 600 sq ft, drawn from 2025-2026 estimates and sources. Room sizes are typical for suites in these hotels, as exact 600 sq ft listings are rare (standard rooms are 300-400 sq ft; suites 500-700 sq ft). Peak rates are for August 2025 (summer high season), while off-peak rates are for January-February 2026 (winter low season, when prices are typically 20-30% lower due to colder weather and reduced tourism). Amenities and feedback are summarized from reviews.",,,,,,,

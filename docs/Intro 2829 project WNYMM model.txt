The WNY Makers Model: A Partnership in the 2829 Niagara St. Project
The WNY Makers Model (WNYMM) is an innovative cooperative development approach for the 2829 Niagara St. project, a venture with over $35M in projected revenue, designed to revolutionize real estate by aligning professional expertise directly with project success.
Here's how it works for partners like your firm:
* In-Kind Investment: Instead of traditional fees, your professional expertise, services, and materials are valued at market rates and treated as a direct equity investment in the project.
* Direct Profit Share: You earn a pro-rata share of the substantial projected profits directly corresponding to your contribution's value.
* Debt-Free Structure: The model operates without traditional bank loans, significantly reducing financial risk and eliminating lender pressures. This allows for strategic market timing and avoids forced sales.
* Accelerated Timelines: Bypassing traditional financing hurdles can shorten development timelines by 6-12 months, leading to a faster return for all partners.
* Active Deal-Making Role: Beyond your primary role, you'll have the opportunity to actively participate in marketing and meeting with potential in-kind partners, leveraging your network for mutual benefit.
* Long-Term Wealth Building: This model offers unique perks like access to reduced unit pricing for partners, the potential for transferred depreciation benefits, and the opportunity to scale your investment into future WNYMM projects.
In essence, you become a vested partner, building equity and sharing in the success of a community-focused, wealth-building project.
